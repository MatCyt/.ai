---

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. 

If working in a code repository, write it as a markdown file to a .scratch/handoffs/<conversation>. 
Otherwise, save to the temporary directory of the user's OS.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
