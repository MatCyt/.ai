I'm considering {{introducing an intensive testing stage before deployment, working in Agile methodology}}.

Your task is to sense the reception of this idea by individual members of my team, namely:

a) [frontend developer]
b) [security specialist]
c) [Chief Revenue Officer]

Consider how they can perceive the benefits, risks, trade-offs of this idea.
Present each person's observations in separate sections.
In case of a negative reception by at least one of these roles propose how this idea could be adjusted to align with their needs.
